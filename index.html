      As I am a great fan of marvel
      Avengers: Endgame', which marks the end of the Infinity Saga, is spellbinding and surely an enthralling experience. The last film of the 'Avengers' franchise is remarkable and doesn't disappoint. Watching all our favorite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. Marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released 'Iron Man'. I'm damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off. The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments. The film has a great balance of humor, emotions, and action. The biggest strength of the film is the emotions. This is the most emotional superhero film I have ever seen. It's just perfect. The action sequences were jaw-dropping. </p>

      As a big fan of this film since childhood, I know that the 1994 version of this visually fantastic movie will never be beaten. Thus, the remake of this film did not reach that goal. However, it did bring some new perspectives for millions of eyes around the world. Jon Favreau, director of many films, including 2016's the Jungle Book, did an excellent job with this CGI remake of the Lion King.
I am proud to be one of several theater witnesses on opening day to watch this wonderfully made film. Although -- admittedly -- the animals don't have a flexible amount of facial expressions, the story, the music, the scenery, to me, is what was most important. I think Jon and the whole cast and crew did a wonderful job recreating a masterpiece, trying not to top it, but trying to expand it a little for the new generation of high film making technology. I did cry a few times, I laughed several times, but my mouth was in awe nearly the entire way through. </p>

      I think this movies is THE BEST I've ever watched!I just finished the series 1 week ago,and they were so good!I wish they never ended.If only Harry and Hermione were a couple,J.K Rowling even said that she did a mistake with ron and hermione and not Harry and Hermione.I haven't watched the last 2 movies,but the books are really good!Harry Potter are my favourite series,and stay tuned for the Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them!
Also J.K Rowling did AMAZING with the Harry Potter movies,if only the movies never ended!! I'm also REALLY sad these books have come to an end,they were THE best of all!!Daniel Radcliffe,Rupert Grint,and Emma Watson,GREAT JOB!!  AMAZING JOB!!And of course the director,David Heyman great job!The only mistake was in the Chamber of Secrets,during the Quidditch Cup with Malfoy,the music was the same as Star Wars?</p>
